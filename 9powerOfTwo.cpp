/*
Program: Check if a Number is a Power of 2
-------------------------------------------
Steps:
1. Prompt the user to input an integer.
2. Start from 1 (which is 2^0) and multiply by 2 in each iteration.
3. Compare the result with the userâ€™s input number.
4. If a match is found, output that the number is a power of 2.
5. If no match is found after the loop, output that the number is not a power of 2.
